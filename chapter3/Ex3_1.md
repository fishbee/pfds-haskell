Exercise 3.1
------------

Prove that the right spine of a leftist heap of size _n_ contains at most floor(log(_n_ + 1)) elements. (Logarithms are base 2.)

_Note: it has been a while since I have done maths in anger, so the following may not be the most rigorous of proofs._

As mentioned in PFDS, as a consequence of the definition of a leftist heap, the right spine is always the shortest path to an empty node. The maximum length of the shortest path occurs when the heap is perfectly balanced.

For a binary tree of maximum depth _d_, a path to an empty node contains at most _d_ elements. Such a tree contains _n_ elements in total, with the maximum value of _n_ occurring when we're dealing with a perfectly balanced tree, where

_n_ = 2^_d_ - 1

Re-arranging, for an arbitrary tree, we get

_d_ * log(2) <= log(_n_ + 1), or

_d_ <= log(_n_ + 1) (for base 2 logs)

Since _d_ must be an integer, we have

_d_ <= floor(log(_n_ + 1))
