This directory contains solutions to exercises in PFDS Chapter 2. Files with
names of the form **Ex2_N.hs** contain solutions to the corresponding exercises. Other Haskell source files contain data structure code taken from PFDS Appendix A.

To run a solution (in this case, that to Exercise 2.2), start `ghci`, and enter `:load Ex2_2.hs`. Any dependencies should be loaded automatically. There usually is some sample data that can be used to play with any exported functions.
