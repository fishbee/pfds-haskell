============

Recently, I begun reading "Purely Functional Data Structures" by Chris Okasaki
(http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0521663504/?tag=fishbee-21). Starting in Chapter 2,
the book contains exercises to illustrate the data structures being discussed.
Although the book uses primarily SML for code samples, I figured my Haskell was
getting rusty, so I should use that instead to do the exercises.

I will be committing solutions to exercises as I do them. They should work with
GHC 7.4.1, as that is what I am using. Let me know if you spot any bugs, or can
suggest any improvements!
